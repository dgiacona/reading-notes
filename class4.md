# My Class 4 Notes

### Wireframe and Design
Wireframe- low fidelity sketch of a digital interface its purpose is planning what will be on the screen before diving into design.

### Steps to make a Wireframe
1. Do your research- this includes understanding your audience and creating user personas and defining use cases.
2. Create a user flow- having a good user flow will lower levels of frustraion by users, also it is impoertant to keep organized helping your information architecture.
3. Keep your wireframes simple- The purpose of a wireframe is to make a sketch using all you information not drawing out each and every detail.
4. Testing- once you have your sketches and wireframes created the next step will be to test them. You are testing for usability.
5. Prototyping- turn your wireframes with all the feedback into a digital prototype and test it more with others when finished.

### Types of Wireframes
1. Paper- hand drawn consisting initial thoughts more on the low fidelity side.
2. Digital- easy to share with other to collect feedback more on the high fidelity side.

### Mozilla HTML Basics
HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Below is the break down of some of the main elements.

1. The opening tag: This states where the element begins or starts to take effect
2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.
3. The content: This is the content of the element between the opening and closing tags.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

### Semantics
Refers to the meaning of a piece of code example being "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" rather than "what does it look like?".

### Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

### Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

### Semantics in CSS
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
