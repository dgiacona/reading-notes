**3 Rules For Creating Images**

1. **Save images in the right format**- websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. Choosing the wrong format can make the image look blurry or make the web page load slower.

2. **Save images at the right size**- You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.

3. **Measure images in pixels**- computer screens are made up of tiny squares known as pixels this is important for resolution of your image.

- **Hex Codes**- hex values represent values for red, green and blue in hexadecimal code, example #66cdaa
- **Color Names**- colors are represented by predefined names but are limited, example Medium Aqua Marine
- **Saturation**- refers to the amount of gray in a color.
- **Brightness**- refers to how much black is in a color. Maximum brightness would have no black in the color.
