# Class 8 Notes

### **Key Concepts in Positioning Elements**

**Building Blocks**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. THis box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- Block level elements- start on a new line including examples include

```html
<h1> <p> <ul> <li>
```

- Inline elements- Flow in between surrounding text

```html
<img> <b> <i>
```

**Containing Elements**
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group elements instide of div.
```html
<div>
```

## Positioning Schemes

- Normal Flow- every block element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.
- Relative Positioning- move the element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
- Absolute Positioning- positions the element in relation to its containing element
- Fixed Positioning- a for of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the broser window as opposed to the containing element.
- Floating Elements- allows you to take the element out of the normal flow and position it far left or right of a containing box
