# Class 2 Notes

### JavaScript Notes

1. You can use JavaScript to select any element, atttribute or text from an HTML document
2. JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying content and markup used in a webpage page.
3. Program rules you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe) which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
4. React to events you can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

### Scripts

Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step

How to write a script:

1. Define the goal- First you need to define the goal you want to achieve. Think of this is the puzzle you want your computer to solve. 
2. Design the script- split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. (Use a flowchart) Then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task 
3. Code each step- each of the steps need to be written in a programming language that the computer understands.

### Comparison operators
===: Strict equal to
!==: Strict not equal to
==: is equal to
!=: is not equal to
<: less than
>: greater than
<=: less than or equal to
=>: greater than or equal to

### Three types of loops
for: loops through items in a list or array.
while: continues to run a block of code while a condition is true.
doâ€¦while: similar to while loop but will run the block of code at least once even if the condition is false.
