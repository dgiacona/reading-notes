# Class 3 Notes

### HTML List

- **Ordered Lists** lists where each item in the list is numbered
- **Unordered Lists** lists that begin with a bullet point
- **Definition Lists** lists that are made up of a set of terms along the definitions for each of those terms

**Ordered List**

```html
<ol>
  <li>place line item here</li>
</ol>```

**Unordered List**
```html
<ul>
  <li>place line item here</li>
</ul>```

**Definition List**
```ntml
<dl>
  <dt>used for the term</dt>
  <dd>used to contain the definition</dd>
</dl>```

### HTML Boxes

Each Box has three properties that you can adjust and control its appearance.

**3 Properties**

- **Border** seperates the edge of one box from another
- **Margin** sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
- **Padding** is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

### Loops

Three Kinds of loops
- For Loops 
- While Loops
- Do While Loops

initialization (var i =0;)
condition (i<10;)
update (i++;)

break - causes termination of loop and to move to code next after the loop statement.
continue - stop current iteration and check the condition again.
