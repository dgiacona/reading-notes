Sharing code for the masses. It is also known as a version control system. Another benefit is Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code. Gitdisplays a history of changes and commits represent each succesful version.

### GitHub
Allows you to share code with others and it is a safe and secure place to store your code. 

### Repository
Collection of files you have told git to pay attention to. One project usually means one repository, but for larger projects there may be multiple repositories used.

### Git Flow
