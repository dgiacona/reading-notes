# My Class 6 Notes

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted programming language with first-class functions. It is most well known as the scripting language for web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
<br/>
<br/>

- Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

- Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
<br/>
<br/>
This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.

### What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values)
<br/>
<br/>

**4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:**
- Using **var**
- Using **let**
- Using **const**
- Using nothing
<br/>
<br/>

**When to Use JavaScript var?**

If you want your code to run in an older browser not traditionally used anymore
<br/>
<br/>

**When to Use JavaScript const?**

If you want a general rule: always declare vairiables with const
<br/>
<br/>

**When to Use JavaScript let?**

If you think the value of a variable can change use let
<br/>
<br/>

>**Example**
>
>**const** price1 =5;
>
>**const** price2 =6;
>
>**let** total = price1 + price2;

<br/>

### Data Types:
- Number - 1,2,3,4
- String - "1", "Hi how are ya?"

>**example**
>
>let number = 1
>
>let word = "one"
>
>number = 2
