# My Class 5 Notes

### What is CSS?

CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet and it allows you to create great looking websites by adding more visual elements to them such as color and layout.

**3 kinds of CSS**
- External CSS- Style for websites (most popular)
- Inline CSS- Slows down HTML Load times (not popular)
- Internal CSS- Great for specific pages
### CSS Syntax 

CSS is a rule that you define by applying them to specific elements on your web page. You use these rules by selecting what elements you are going to style and utilize a set of curly braces "{ }" inside these curly braces you will write you **declarations** 

>**Example**
>
>h1 {
> 
> color: Red;
>
> font-size: 24px;
>
>}

### CSS Modules
As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. 

### CSS Specifications
All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.
