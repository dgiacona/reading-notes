## List and Keys
- We use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. 
- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.
- When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section.
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

## The Spread Operator
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

### Used for:
- Copying an array
- Concatenating or combining arrays
- Using Math functions
- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list
- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects
- Converting NodeList to an array

Using the Spread operator is a convenient way to copy an array.


## How to pass Functions Between Components
Create the function whereever the state is going to change.
