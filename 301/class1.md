## Components

### What is a “component”?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

### What are the characteristics of a component?
- Reusability - components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
1. Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
2. Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
3. Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
4. Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
5. Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
6. Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
7. System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
8. Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.


## React

### What is “props” short for?
**“Props”** is a special keyword in React, which stands for **properties** and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### How are props used in React?
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data


### What is the flow of props?
Data with props are being passed in a **uni-directional flow.** (one way from parent to child) Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
