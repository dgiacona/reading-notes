## What types of things can you pass in the props?
Props you can think about as like arguments to a function when you create a component inside of react and you want to render it you're going to pass it the props



## What is the big difference between props and state?
The big difference is props you pass into a component and state is handled inside of that component and props are handled outside of the component.



## When do we re-render our application?
When you change the state inside of your application it's going to re-render that section of your application but props you can't actually change them you need to change them outside the component


## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
State is there for when you need to actually rerender and update your application based on something the user has done
