# My Reading Notes

## About Me
My name is Dominic Giacona and I'm  currently located in DC. I'm a navy vet and I've been doing a lot of work with UX/UI designing tech products for clients. As I find myself designing these products I want to learn how to build the taking everything from A to Z. Becoming a software engineer is my goal and being able to make the imagination tangible. My coding experience is very minimal with html and css. I am so excited for this chapter of my life and having the opportunity to learn this skill and challenge myself.
