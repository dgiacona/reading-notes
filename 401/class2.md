## A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.

- Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
- Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
- Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.


## What is Recursion?Â 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

## Need of Recursion

Recursion is an amazing technique with the help of which we can reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.

## Properties of Recursion:

Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.
In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur.
