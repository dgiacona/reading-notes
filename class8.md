# My Class 8 Notes

### What are operators and loops?

JavaScript uses special operators to express common behaviors between variables.

**Comparison Operators**

- Equal(==)- Returns true if operands are equal
- Not equal(!=)- Returns true if operands are not equal
- Strict equal(===)- Returns true if operands are equal and of same type
- Strict not equal(!==)- Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of differant type

- Greater than(>)- Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand
- Less than(<)- Returns true if the left operand is greater than the left operand

**Arithmatic Operators**

- Remainder(%)- Binary operator. Returns the integer remainder of dividing two operands

- Increment(++)- Unary operator that adds one to its operand. If used as ++x then returns the value of its operand after adding one. If used as x++ then returns the value before incrementing by one. -Decrement(--)- Same as increments but subtracts 1

- Unary Negations(-)- Unary operator that returns the negation of its operand. (ex. x=3. -x=-3) -Exponentiation ( ** )- calculate the bas to the exponent power. (base**power)

**What are Loops?**
- Quick and easy way to repeat some code 
- A sequence of instructions repeat continually until a condition is reached
- Used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks under a condition

**While Loop**
- A loop that will keep repeating while a certian condition is met
- Type of loop that will repeat UNTIL a condition is achieved 

**For Loop**
- Repeats for as long as we will tell it to
- Repeated a specific amount of times
